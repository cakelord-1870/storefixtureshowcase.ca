    <title>Toronto Mannequins in Store Windows</title>

      <![CDATA[<p>All over the City of Toronto there are mannequins in store windows doing the difficult job of looking human to bring high fashion clothing to life and make shops appear more <em>humane</em>. Here are some interesting pictures from big brand stores and second hand fashion retailers.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1618/2961/files/TOmannequins8_grande.jpg?v=1499124909" alt=""></p>
<p>As seen on Queen West where the street meets King and Roncesvalles Ave there's a trendy vintage clothing shop with headless mannequins modeling summer fashions. By and large the mannequins on Queen Street West are headless - the store windows communicate clothing styles without emotion or any lifestyle implications.</p>
<p>At Harry Rosen, the figures in the window suggest a posh and sophisticated lifestyle choice. These are clothes for important people.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1618/2961/files/TOmannequins7_grande.jpg?v=1499125250" alt="Harry Rosen Mannequin suggests an upscale lifestyle choice"></p>
<p>And if the passer-by happens to have another cultural perspective, there's another window on the opposite side of the same entrance to catch his or her eyes and hopefully plant a seed or spark the impulse to buy these garments.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Harry Rosen black plastic mannequin in Yorkville" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1618/2961/files/TOmannequins6_grande.jpg?v=1499125424" style="float: none; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></p>
<p>The mannequins in Yorkville have their heads held high. Their eyes are always pointed out toward the street and up, never down (in shame). Even when the store window is above the would-be shopper's head, these plastic people will never look down. Their proud heads are held high in great confidence. Look at the wonderful half mannequin legs showing lacy red stockings. Earlier versions of this piece would only have legs and not the midsection, with black panties, as seen below.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1618/2961/files/TOmannequins2_grande.jpg?v=1499126404" alt="Mannequin on Cumberland Ave"></p>
<p>There are some exceptions to the proud head rule in Yorkville and that includes the headless maternity mannequins at Carry a high fashion maternity wear store on Cumberland Ave. These headless women all show how possible it is to still look beautiful with a big belly while expecting a baby.</p>

<p>I will add more images and stories as I find them this summer. Keep checking back. Ping me if you know of any good stores with good displays or better yet send me the pictures and notes, and I will add them to this blog post.</p>

    <title>Mannequin Adds to Hogtown&apos;s Super Slam Wrestling Story</title>

      <![CDATA[<p>Proof that mannequins can make any display of apparel more human just happened at the most recent <a href="http://www.hogtownwrestling.com" target="_blank" title="Hogtown Wrestling" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hogtown Wrestling</a> event in downtown Toronto last weekend. The tall white male mannequin we donated to the administrators graced the stage at the very front of the auditorium, and made a big impact on the audience. And he impacted the wrestlers too, one in particular.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="Ablelin mannequin at wrestling show in Toronto" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1618/2961/files/Wrestking-Man1_large.jpg?v=1496889933" style="float: none;"></p>
<p><strong>Hogtown's Sunday June 4th 2017 Super Slam Five</strong> extravaganza was a fantastic exhibition of wrestling form. Our mannequin added to this energetic event by simply remaining stationary in the background.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="Hogtown Wrestling TV Title Belt on plastic mannequin" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1618/2961/files/Wrestking-Man2a_large.jpg?v=1496889946" style="float: none;"></p>
<p>The administrators used our mannequin to bring to life their TV Title Belt. This is the single greatest award to which all the Hogtown wrestlers aspire, and showing it off on stage like this was meaningful on so many levels.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="wrestling belt at Super Slam Five " src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1618/2961/files/Wrestking-belt_large.jpg?v=1496889953" style="float: none;"></p>
<p>All through the Super Slam spectacle our <a href="https://storefixtureshowcase.ca/collections/plastic-mannequin/products/male-plastic-mannequin" title="white male plastic mannequin">white male plastic mannequin</a> remained upright with the TV Title Belt affixed to its torso.  It served as a statuesque reminder of the highest honour each individual wrestler could achieve in this tournament. See below how the towering figure on stage seems to stand in judgement of the warriors struggling to score below.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1618/2961/files/w-restlng-ring-dman_large.jpg?v=1496890033" alt="" width="457" height="300"></p>
<p>The mannequin played an important role in the proceedings by reminding everyone of the glorious victory that could be theirs when and if they take the TV Title belt.</p>
<p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4199/35176072445_5a7c3a5358_z.jpg" alt="" width="462" height="308"></p>
<p>There were ten wrestlers ready to take the belt and all of these athletes had been waiting years for their chance (except for two heroes who were past Champions). So on that fateful Sunday afternoon the administrators of the League decided on a Round Robin tournament style with five matches of one on one wrestling leading to a final Five Man Circle Match to decide the new Champion.</p>
<p>And that's just what happened. The final five wrestlers squared off against each other, every man for himself, in the last and most exciting match of the event.</p>
<p>It was during this final showdown that Rage chased Nick Watts up onto the stage area and they had a scuffle near the plastic mannequin. The audience gasped as Rage got set to 'pounce' his signature move and Nick pushed the Mannequin into his path to make his escape.</p>
<p>Below is the exact moment when Nick Watts sidestepped Rage's pounce and put our mannequin in his path. Whamo!</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1618/2961/files/mannequin-wrestling1_large.jpg?v=1496890000" alt="rage impacts the abelin mannequin" width="460" height="341"></p>
<p>The mannequin's chest was crushed into impact but it was Rage that came up dazed and confused, sportiing a bloody scalp. This was not ketchup - its real blood. Our plastic mannequins hit hard!</p>
<p>Sadly, for this dummy (the mannequin) it was his last act of retaliation. The unit's arms and legs came off, and the head and chest fell down into the crevice between the wrestling ring and the stage.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1618/2961/files/mannequin-wrestling2_large.jpg?v=1496890008" alt="" width="467" height="381"></p>
<p>To the horror of the other wrestlers, (and yet much to the delight of the crowd) the broken mannequin's arms and legs then became blood-soaked weapons for wrestlers! See below how Rage, now recovered from his misapplied pounce used the mannequin arm to pummel D-Man!</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1618/2961/files/DSC03701-600x400_large.jpg?v=1496896022" alt="" width="461" height="307"></p>
<p>Let it be known we do not condone this kind of violence in real life and we hope that our store fixtures are never used to hurt other people, unless theyre wearing wrestling tights and have been specially trained on how to take a mannequin arm in the face.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4245/34996963001_c8fd4616cf_z.jpg" style="float: none;" width="413" height="275"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">D-Man dominated the match in the end and won the title belt and the stage was suddenly filled with the 'evil wrestlers' who now seem to have the upper hand in that story-filled wrestling league this summer. One thing is certain, despite losing a high quality male plastic mannequin in the last grand slam, Ablelin Store Fixtures remains committed to Hogtown Wrestling and will continue to sponsor and provide for all the organization's retail display needs.</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Interior decoration for retail stores is not simply aesthetically pleasing art, its fiscally responsible science .Successful business owners need to learn this discipline to build effective stores that can more efficiently showcase merchandise in a calm and uncluttered environment. Shoppers don't like distractions. And they don't like dark stores with cramped aisles and poorly conceived layouts will ill-fitting shelves that diminish the shopping experience and downplay the quality of the goods for sale.<img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1618/2961/files/Dr_Archer_new_dental_office1-1024x768_grande.jpg?v=1495056606" alt="Archer Dental renovating front desk and waiting room area "></p>
<p>Dr Natalie Archer seen above in 2014 renovated her dental clinic waiting room to have a friendlier receptionist desk complete with a cascading bubble wall. Both fixtures help put her clients more at ease when they wait for dental surgery. The same rules apply for retail stores. The front counter (<a href="https://storefixtureshowcase.ca/blogs/store-fixture-showcase-blog/retail-store-design-front-sales-counter-should-not-be-up-front" title="front sales counter should not be front of store">which should not be up front of store</a> as per this earlier blog post) can also be mildly intimidating to many consumers.</p>
<p>The checkout counter should be a welcoming shrine of consumer confidence and in some ways its quality should 'match' the quality of the consumers your store hopes to attract. Look at the image below from a country magazine showing the ladies in a small town dress shop. See how this old fashion front sales counter perfectly matches the decor and marvel at how efficient that display is for featuring specialty items - its full of merchandise, and yet seems uncluttered.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="old fashion dress boutique sales counter" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1618/2961/files/gorgeous-display-case1_grande.jpg?v=1495048248" style="float: none;"></p>
<p>A retail store checkout counter should never be 'unhandy' for the shoppers or the sales staff. See below how our friend at A2ZPC repair on Dundas St West didn't like the small box windows in the back of the cabinet and asked us for better counters with merchandise more easily accessed and ones that would better display their wide array of electronic merchandise..</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1618/2961/files/store1dix_grande.jpg?v=1495057761" alt="awkward sales counter in retail store in Toronto"></p>
<p>Awkward fixtures are not only unhelpful for closing business transactions, but they can be unsafe. Many store owners with bad shelving or bulky wall cabinets that do not quite fit their space have bruises on their legs and arms from constantly bumping into their furniture. Bad fixtures can also promote crime.</p>
<p>Another issue with the Toronto PC repair shop's interior store cabinets was the heat inside the boxes. Some of these sales cabinets were parked in the sun of course as the shop is sunny and warm. But the sunlight heat was detrimental to the products in storage and offered limitations for 'playing' anything that would make even more heat in these ventilated chambers. The shop owner asked us for counters with increased ventilation and this problem was solved, or will be, by moving some ventilation resources into the bottoms of the new counters seen below.</p>

<p>Sales counter showcases including the <a href="https://storefixtureshowcase.ca/pages/display-showcase-and-counter" title="glass aluminium sales counters for retail stores">glass and aluminum display showcases for retail stores</a> seen above are key ingredients to planning eye-catching and appealing displays. This beautiful glass box is being altered for the PC repair shop to have a perforated bottom so staff should not be afraid to try something different or play any device they like behind the glass.</p>
<p>With so much selection available to retail store owners today, there's no excuse for  awkward shops with inefficient store fixtures that diminish the pleasure of shopping.</p>

    <title>Retail Store Design - Front Sales Counter Should Not Be Up Front</title>

      <![CDATA[<p>In Toronto Ontario Canada new stores fashioned in concrete at street level and in the basements and underground 'Pathway', a massive shopping mall which connect many of the downtown skyscrapers, are much smaller than older stores in old brick buildings across 'main street' Canada. Modern merchandisers in this city must truly maximize their limited space, and adopt innovations like <a href="https://storefixtureshowcase.ca/pages/display-showcase-and-counter" title="glass sales counters and cabinets for retail stores">glass and aluminum display case</a> to put stuff on display even as shoppers are buying their goods and leaving the store.  <a href="https://storefixtureshowcase.ca/collections/aluminum-showcases-and-counters/products/triangle-aluminum-corner-showcase" title="triangular metal frame glass aluminium sales counter">Triangular glass and aluminum frame display cases</a> maximize the corners and make showcases to catch consumers' eyes. Having a small thriving business in a busy location can be a recipe for success and is far preferable than having many locations do only a modest trade. The congested downtown core is heaven for smart entrepreneurs with good 'concept stores' that have interesting floor plans and smart fixtures.</p>
<p>In the last decade the price of housing and of course commercial office and retail space too has doubled in Toronto and will likely do so again next decade.  So much like the precedents set in Tokyo and New York City the little shops get squeezed together in the crush that is our new and 'denser' urban reality.</p>
<h3>Today retailers are forced to consider new floor plans with smarter fixtures to better maximize the amount of merchandise on display.</h3>
<p>Here's Andy Ientile a Toronti area serial entrepreneur that's very excited to be opening an organic grocery market in Liberty Village.  He has a challenging space to contend with as he crafts the interior design of his dreams with the limited furnishings and decor he can find and afford today.</p>
<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1618/2961/files/Liberty-Organic2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1494763086" alt=""></p>
<p>After contemplating his floor plan for many months, Andy brought in professional help (who in turn called us to supply his store fixtures) because there are so many factors to be considered when designing a modern supermarket.</p>
<p>As we walked through the space with Andy we soon discovered that some things can be moved, while other business elements must remain. He cannot adjust the position of the front door for example or the shape of the space he's renting, and also there are fixed elements in the store - ie the meat and fish poultry eggs and dairy must be kept refrigerated at the back and along the left side of the box shaped store as this is where the power supply and service is and also this area is most accessible for deliveries. The produce will be kept up front where it can be seen in the window and be the first thing people encounter inside the market. But where to put the checkout counter?</p>
<h3>Where to put the front desk has been the topic of discussion for some time in the world of retail store design.</h3>
<p>For many years this check-out area was right up front and used to actually block or guard the front door. If the retailer needs to see store merchandise on the sidewalk out front then he or she might have good reason to be near the entrance and may even choose to elevate the counter area sightly on a riser and keep the opening close to the front door for quicker pursuit and apprehensive of shoplifters. But these things shouldn't affect store design's number one priority - to put consumers in a comfortable space where they can relax and contemplate the potentialities of each purchase.</p>
<p>The front entrance of any store is a decompression zone of sorts and shouldn't be cluttered or conflicted with the dynamic action of people leaving the store.  Thus in many cases you will notice the entrance is on the right hand side of the shop while people leave on the left hand side. If there is the possibility of setting up your store like a racetrack and encouraging the same behaviour as people driving then you should always consider this design. This layout works especially well in grocery stores and supermarkets where people natural push wheeled carts. </p>
<p>The 'front' desk seems well positioned on the left side of the store against the wall where possible and seamlessly integrated into the retail concept.  People on their way out should not impact or affect the forward movement of those entering the venue.</p>

    <title>Retail Store Fixtures Really Matter to Bricks and Mortar Businesses</title>

      <![CDATA[<p>In the future, the most successful retail shops may be the most 'social' venues, and the most aesthetically pleasing places to do business.</p><p><a class="read-more" href="https://storefixtureshowcase.ca/blogs/store-fixture-showcase-blog/why-retail-store-fixtures-matter-to-the-future-of-bricks-and-mortar-businesses-in-mississauga">More</a></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>Having attractive store fixtures, clean <a href="https://storefixtureshowcase.ca/collections/aluminum-showcases-and-counters" title="glass cabinet tower">aluminum glass showcases</a> and  counters and unique <a href="https://storefixtureshowcase.ca/collections/plastic-mannequin" title="plastic mannequins">plastic mannequins</a> is a good start. Having the exact perfect size cabinets and shelving for a symmetrical display of merchandise is critical to presenting a sense of balance and 'fairness' in the store.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="attractive mannequins behind shop counter " src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1618/2961/files/mannequin-evolution-15Apr2017_grande.jpg?v=1492517591" style="float: none; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>Futurists often predict the worst things for retail stores in Canada. They get gloomy over the growth of online shopping websites and forecast the continued to erosion of all but the strongest and most unique all bricks and mortar operations. While there are some lessons to be learned for sure, the truth is that many<strong> people like to get out of their homes and go shopping with friends,</strong> and its hard to imagine that changing anytime soon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1618/2961/files/Abellin7_grande.jpg?v=1492564177" style="float: none;"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The butcher shop with the park-bench along the wall does four times more business that the larger, more modern and better illuminated meat shop across the street because the bench brings the neigbourhood into the store.  </p>
<p>Shopping malls, market squares and distinct neighbourhood 'main streets' will always be busy because people have to get out of their houses and go see each other now and then. So if we understand that, then it becomes more a question of '<em>how to bring those curious would-be consumers into the store?</em>'</p>
<p>Retail concepts that are well executed with bold themes that say something about society are by far the best approach. The shopping excursion should be memorable and feel special for all participants even those 'just visiting' and not buying any items today will be helpful to spread the word tomorrow.</p>
<p>The ceilings, floors windows and walls of the space should be used, not necessarily for sales displays but to make a homogeneous themed space. Clothing racks on the walls can come alive with the human form by dressing the <a href="/collections/male-and-female-body-form-free-standing-torso" title="male and female hanging body forms">hanging half mannequin forms</a> seen below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1618/2961/files/DSC02152_grande.JPG?v=1494758714" style="float: none;" width="544" height="817"></p>
<p>By painting the ceilings and floors and affecting a curious theme on the walls and in the windows of the  shop, the 'retail concept' can communicate what the shopper COULD become, and the transformation that is possible in them personally... Imagine if the store could plant the idea that shoppers MUST have the merchandise to be acceptable next season, next semester or next weekend? Stores like that become more like portals to different possibilities and champions to the values that affect their lifestyle choices.</p>
<p>Case in point - below is a shiny black plastic mannequin that is central to the window display at Got Style in the Distillery District of Toronto. This retail store has many return customers who come to the shop for ideas as well as clothing items.  The mannequins in the shop reflect what they COULD become next season, not just what they would look like if they buy the fashion merchandise on display. If the 'possibility' is appealing then more shoppers will enter the venue and sales will rise.</p>
<p><img src="https://lifeasahuman.com/files/2017/04/GotStyleman3-17Apr2017-650x453.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>High quality store fixtures are an important part of the overall retail concept messaging; good furnishings and decor bring credibility and structure to design.and good fixtures that perfectly match the overall theme can dramatically increase sales and yield more repeat business.</p>
